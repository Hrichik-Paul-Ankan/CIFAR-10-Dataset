# CIFAR-10-Dataset
This Python project involves building and evaluating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented in Jupyter Notebook, the project demonstrates image classification using advanced neural network architectures and traditional machine learning methods.
